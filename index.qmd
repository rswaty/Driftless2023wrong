## Goals 

-   Use [LANDFIRE](https://landfire.gov/) products to:
    -   characterize ecosystems, past and present
    -   compare historical and current fire regimes
    -   identify under and over represented succession classes 
-   Leverage data from the [Center for Resilient Conservation Science](https://crcs.tnc.org/) to:
    -   quantify and map carbon values
    -   map resilient and connected areas
    
## Goals continued

-   Leverage data from the [Center for Resilient Conservation Science](https://crcs.tnc.org/) to:
    -   quantify and map carbon values
    -   map resilient and connected areas

## Notes on historical ecosystems

- Most dominant 5 historical ecosystems (ones mapped) covered ~80% of the landscape
- SE to NW line close to state border represents a LANDFIRE Map Zone.  These are essentially 'data delivery polygons' and may/may not represent ecological borders
- Dominant ecosystems were fire-adapted/dependent (more on that in later slide)

*LANDFIRE [Biophysical Settings](https://landfire.gov/bps.php) data was used for the 'historical ecosystems' chart and map.*
