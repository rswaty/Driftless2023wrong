## Goals

-   Use [LANDFIRE](https://landfire.gov/) products to:
    -   ecosystems, past and present
    -   compare historical and current fire regimes
    -   identify under and over represented succession classes for dominant ecosystems
    -   characterize existing vegetation cover and height
-   Leverage data from the [Center for Resilient Conservation Science](https://crcs.tnc.org/) to:
    -   quantify and map carbon values
    -   map resilient and connected areas

## Historical Ecosystems, Quantified

-   These top 10 cover most of the landscape
-   Fire adapted ecosystems were dominant
