## Goals

-   Use [LANDFIRE](https://landfire.gov/) products to:
    -   ecosystems, past and present
    -   compare historical and current fire regimes
    -   identify under and over represented succession classes for dominant ecosystems
    -   characterize existing vegetation cover and height
-   Leverage data from the [Center for Resilient Conservation Science](https://crcs.tnc.org/) to:
    -   quantify and map carbon values
    -   map resilient and connected areas

## Historical Ecosystems, Quantified

## Historical Ecosystems, Mapped

## Historical Ecosystems, Observations

- The top 10 in the chart cover ~90% the landscape, the top 5 in the map cover ~80%
- Fire adapted ecosystems were dominant
- "Line" that goes from SE to NW follows LANDFIRE "Map Zones" (essentially data delivery polygons) line.  This pattern may or may not be "real".

```{r}

hist_fire_chart <- ggplot(data = hist_fire, 
                          aes(fill = fire_type, 
                              y = acres, 
                              x = reorder(BPS_NAME, acres))) +

## Current Ecosystems, Quantified

![](img/evtChart.png){fig-alt="A drawing of an elephant."}

## Current Ecosystems, Mapped

![](img/evt.png){fig-alt="A drawing of an elephant."}

## Current Ecosystems, Observations

- The top 10 in the chart cover ~90% the landscape, the top 5 in the map cover ~75%
- Of the remining natural vegetation, the North-Central Interior Dry-Mesic Oak Forest and Woodland is dominant
- ~20% of the area was mapped as 'ruderal' or 'pasture'...these areas may present an opportunity for restoration

## Conversion

```{r}


# read in snkyPdata
snkyPdata <- read_csv("data/bps2evt_sankey.csv")

# define nodes
nodes <- data.frame(
         name=c(as.character(snkyPdata$source), 
         as.character(snkyPdata$target)) %>% 
          unique())

# add source and target fields
snkyPdata$IDsource <- match(snkyPdata$source, nodes$name)-1 
snkyPdata$IDtarget <- match(snkyPdata$target, nodes$name)-1

# Make the Network
snkyP2 <- sankeyNetwork(Links = snkyPdata, 
                       Nodes = nodes,
                       Source = "IDsource", 
                       Target = "IDtarget",

## Conversion notes

* For the chart
    * Historical BpSs on the left.  Bars sized by amount converted (not amount originally present).  Highly grouped Existing Vegetation Type data on the right. 
    * Hover over horizontal bars to highlight connections for that system (e.g., hover over Agriculture to see what was converted to it)
* ~4.5M acres of Oak Savanna has been converted; ~ 2.4M acres of that was converted to agricultural land types and ~1.3M is now mapped as 'Hardwood' types.
